## About Me  
I’m currently starting a master in **Big Data and Cloud** at *EDEM*.  
I hold a degree in **Business Administration and Management** from the Polytechnic University and I am currently based in Valencia, actively seeking new professional opportunities.  

Throughout my studies, I gained experience working with business management software (including **SAP SE**), which helped me develop practical skills in **data analysis** and **organizational processes**.  
I am eager to continue learning and enhancing my expertise, especially in **digital tools** that drive decision-making and business innovation.
